This is definitely 'above our paygrade' and not what we will be focusing on, but it is good to be aware of.

    "1. **Model**: The model you are using to generate the response. In our case, we are using the `gemini-1.5-flash` model.\n",
    "2. **Parameters**: Parameters are additional settings or options that you can send to the model to guide the response. We will cover these in more detail later in the lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Model\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `temperature`: This parameter controls the randomness of the model's response. A temperature of 0 is deterministic, meaning the model will always return the same response for a given prompt. A temperature between 0 and 1 will make the response more random. \n",
