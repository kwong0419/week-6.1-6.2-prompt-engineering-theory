## Climate Change: A Complex and Urgent Issue

Climate change is a long-term shift in average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. These shifts may be natural, but since the 19th century, human activities have been the dominant driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

**Causes:**

* **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy releases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. 
* **Deforestation:** Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so deforestation reduces this natural carbon sink. 
* **Agriculture:** Livestock farming produces significant amounts of methane, and agricultural practices contribute to deforestation and soil degradation, which release carbon dioxide. 
* **Industrial Processes:** Certain industries, such as cement
